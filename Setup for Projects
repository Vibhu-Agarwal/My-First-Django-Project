Adding URLs in Django Application
-->> Three Step Process <<--
1) Add a urls.py file (just like in the mysite folder) in the individual
   application's directory to specify the relative paths with respect to the
   current application and also provide the routing function to run on visiting at
   that url
2) In urls.py in mysite folder, add the urls.py (from the individual applications)
   to the urlpatterns using django.urls.include() and give the path for the
   application's pages
3) In views.py file, create routing functions for rendering pages of the application
   using respective requests and response libraries of django
